{"en":{"title":"Biography","image":"peter-nilsson-portrait.jog","paragraphs":["I grew up in a village in rural Sweden, in the neighbourhood of the Orrefors Glassworks. I have always been sketching and designing using everything I could get my hands on. Living in that neighbourhood, glass became the most natural material to use.  I was surrounded by kind grownups who let me play in their workshops. I decided to become a glass engraver when I was seven years old.","After graduation from the the senior highschool program at the National Glass School in Orrefors, I was hired as a glass engraver at Pukebergs Glassworks. I stayed there for seven years as an engraver, assisting different designers. At age 26 I went to university to study art history and ethnology.","On New Year's Eve in 1994, Mats Jonasson called and asked if I might be interested in working for him as an art director assistant. The job involved solving technical problems and representing the company abroad. One day an artist friend said to me, \"You have been creating glass items as long as I have known you. Why donÂ´t you grab the bull by the horns and get yourself a design education?\"","I followed that advice and went back to university. After graduating I started to work as a freelance designer for Bsweden Belysningsbolaget, and for Nybro Crystal. I started to work at the Swedish National Glass School as a teacher in coldworking techniques, sketching techniques, and art history. I stayed at the glass school for nine years, the last five as the head teacher.","In September 2010 I emigrated to Australia where I have been working as a freelance glass artist."]}}
