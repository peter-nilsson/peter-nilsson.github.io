{"en":{"title":"Artistic statement","paragraphs":["For me, glass represents a fantastic medium for pictures and shapes. A material that is transparent and almost invisible is better than a blank canvas and can be shaped and filled with almost anything. A sculpture in glass can be looked at, into, and through.","I, like so many artists, get my main inspiration from nature. A form, a colour, the movement in the human body, or the subtile communication you can get with an animal that shows the same curiosity as you do in the interaction.","I often use lamination to create my sculptures, as it makes it possible to seal the engravings inside the solid form. I like to play with the observer's eye; the figure you see inside the sculpture is only a hollow space. I must admit that, when I start working, the figures often start living their own lives and the end result often diverges from my original idea.","I often use the human body in my works, as well as animal figures, although I don´t make pure portraits. My thoughts very often circulate around—to catch or be caught; when it's worth putting up a struggle or when it's right to go with the flow; what our options are to take control or whether we are just exposed to the elements.","When I moved to Australia from Sweden a few years ago I realised how similar the cultural mentality is. I guess both Australians and Swedes are nature romantics. We have to deal with nature in a respectful way otherwise it will deal with us. We are not guests who watch and visit nature once in a while. We are a part of it, whether we like it or not."]}}
